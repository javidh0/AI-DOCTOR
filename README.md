# AI-DOCTOR
This project introduces an AI Doctor powered by the K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) machine-learning algorithm

## Abstract:

This project presents the development of an AI-driven medical diagnostic system designed to provide accurate and timely medical recommendations. Utilizing the K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) machine learning algorithm, the system has been trained on an extensive dataset comprising 132 health parameters and over 5000 observations. The AI Doctor's primary objective is to assist medical professionals by offering preliminary insights into potential diagnoses based on input data provided by patients.

Through a rigorous training process, the KNN algorithm learns patterns and relationships within the dataset, enabling it to make informed predictions about a patient's health condition. By employing 132 parameters encompassing a wide spectrum of medical indicators, the AI Doctor seeks to enhance the accuracy and reliability of its assessments.

The system's interface allows patients to input their health data, which is then processed by the KNN model to generate possible medical diagnoses. While the AI Doctor does not replace professional medical expertise, it serves as a valuable tool to aid medical practitioners in their decision-making processes and potentially expedite diagnosis procedures.

This project contributes to the growing field of AI applications in healthcare by showcasing the capabilities of the KNN algorithm in medical diagnosis. It highlights the potential for AI to support medical professionals and enhance patient care by harnessing the power of data-driven insights. As healthcare continues to evolve, the AI Doctor represents a step forward in leveraging technology to improve diagnostic accuracy and patient outcomes.
